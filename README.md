	4) Victory Conditions

##Setup:
	I. Start screen displays message prompt about the game's premise. Select start button. Map displays when loaded.

	II. When map loads, the map is divided into a grid of columns and rows, where the map will be randomly but evenly populated with one troop per location for player one, player two, or neutral. So if there were 45 cells in the grid, each would occupy 15 cells, randomly. 

	III. Players roll to determine who gets to place first batch of troops. High roll wins. The player who wins the roll first deploy two of his own troops on the territory that is under his "domain" or color. He/she will then deploy two neutral troops on "neutral" occupied zones. The other player does the same. This cycle goes until there are 40 troops per player (including neutral) on the map. When all troops allotted are placed, the game will automatically begin. Note that once you place your troops, you cannot change undo your decisions.  

##Playing the Game: Turn-based Mechanics 

	I. DEPLOY PHASE: In this phase, players count the territories they own and divide it by three (rounded down). So if a player owns 13 cells, he/she gets 4 recruits. That is the amount of recruits you get at the beginning of each turn. Proceed to place your units in your domain territory. Select 'next phase' to advance to attack phase.

	II. ATTACK PHASE: To make an attack, player first selects one of his/her domain province as the attacker. Note that attackers can only attack provinces that are up-down-left-right adjacent (or otherwise indicated with routes shown by the mouse hover highlights). The player can then select the target to attack, within its range. Players can check the color of the side panel to see which phase he/she is currently in, along with other map information. You cannot move troops during the attack phase. However when attackers successfully invade a province, you must move as many troops as the dice you throw. Select 'next phase' to advance to fortify phase.

	III. FORTIFY PHASE: To fortify, this phase allows players to move troops around their domain territory. Each troop may only move up to one cell away (or one route spacing away). Once you are done, select 'end turn.' 

#Rules of Combat Engagement: Greater Pairs
	
The basic idea is that when players roll to decide combat results, the highest pair wins. To determine the victor of a roll, consider the amount of dices each player is rolling with. 

	I. Attackers can have up to 3 dices maximum if, after leaving one stationed on the origin province of attack, you have 3 or more attacking troops. (2 dices for 2 troops, 1 dice for 1 troop) 

	II. Defenders can have up to 2 dices maximum if it has 2 troops stationed in the province when it is attacked. (1 dice for 1 troop stationed) 

	III. Defenders always win tie rolls. This is if all the highest rolls are matched up to be ties. 

	IV. Dice roll matchup is subject to the greater roll. 

		In other words, if a player rolls a 6 and 5, while the other player rolls 6 and 4, the 6's will be paired to a 'tie', in which case the defender wins. The 5 will pair with the 4, beating it. 

		Remember to always compare the highest rolls of both players first, before going on to the next highest roll pair. 


##Victory Conditions

	I. Conquer all territory of the other player's domain (not the entire map necessarily). Of course, any unconditional surrender would be valid as well!
